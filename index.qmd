## About Me

Welcome to my website. I am a high school student at [Dublin Coffman High School](https://coffman.dublinschools.net/) and dual enrolled at the [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu). I am interested in mathematics, physics, computer science, and electrical engineering. During high school I participated in mathematics, physics, chemistry and informatics olympiads. You can find my resume [here].

## Papers and Publications
1.  **Predicting Market States and Optimizing Investment Strategies: A Machine Learning Approach**\
    *Authors: Jalen Francis, Farhan Sadeek, Jayson Clark, Aditya Bhati, Andrew McKenzie*\
    *Abstract:* This research presents a machine learning-based system for predicting market states and optimizing investment strategies using S&P 500 data from 2008-2022.
    The system classifies market periods as Bull, Bear, or Static, and employs ensemble and deep learning models to forecast future conditions, dynamically allocating assets between equities and bonds.
    The Combined Anomaly-Regime strategy achieved a 56.34% total return with better risk-adjusted performance compared to a buy-and-hold approach. You can find the paper [here.](QuantifyAI.pdf)

2.  **SignifyAI: Enhancing Communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through ASL Spelling and Gesture Detection**\
    *Authors: Jalen Francis, Farhan Sadeek, Jayson Clark*\
    *Abstract:* This research introduces a real-time system to enhance communication for deaf or hard of hearing individuals by integrating ASL gesture recognition and facial emotion detection.
    Using deep learning models, the system translates ASL finger-spelling into text, recognizes hand gestures, and detects facial expressions to convey emotions and grammatical nuances.
    The solution aims to improve accessibility and inclusivity in educational, professional, and social settings, as demonstrated by user studies and performance metrics. You can find the paper [here.](SignifyAI.pdf)

## Teaching

During the sprign 2025 semester, I was a teaching assistant for [CSE 2231: Software Development and Design](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2231/web-sw1/schedule.html) at The Ohio State University.
You can find some content from that class [here](https://notes.farhansadeek.com/Ohio_State/cse2231/notes/cse2231.pdf).

I started writing my notes in latex during lecture since the spring semester of 2025 as a transition to my mathematics and physics degree in collge. They are not so well written because I am still learning to live Latex. You can find them on this [notes.farhansadeek.com](https://notes.farhansadeek.com)

## Writing

When I was in high school, I took the [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu) courses through through the [Academy Program](https://academy.osu.edu/), and I was lucky enough to advice some young students about their transition from high school to college courses. Based on that experience I wrote these two articles. I wil write more as I get more time and experience.

1.  [Difference between Computer Science and Programming](https://notes.farhansadeek.com/advice/CS.pdf) : For beginners interested in programming and Computer Science and how learn both of those subfields effectively and efficiently.
2.  [Learning Physics](https://notes.farhansadeek.com/advice/Physics.pdf) People who want to study physics.


## Miscellaneous
Outside of academics, I enjoy biking, hiking, and running. I am also an avid photographer and a fan of soccer. My favorite team is FC Barcelona.
