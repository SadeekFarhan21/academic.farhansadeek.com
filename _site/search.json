The system classifies market periods as Bull, Bear, or Static, and employs ensemble and deep learning models to forecast future conditions, dynamically allocating assets between equities and bonds. The Combined Anomaly-Regime strategy achieved a 56.34% total return with better risk-adjusted performance compared to a buy-and-hold approach.\nPreprint\nSignifyAI: Enhancing Communication for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through ASL Spelling and Gesture Detection\nAuthors: Jalen Francis, Farhan Sadeek, Jayson Clark, Aditya Bhati, Andrew McKenzie\nAbstract: This research introduces a real-time system to enhance communication for deaf or hard of hearing individuals by integrating ASL gesture recognition and facial emotion detection. Using deep learning models, the system translates ASL finger-spelling into text, recognizes hand gestures, and detects facial expressions to convey emotions and grammatical nuances. The solution aims to improve accessibility and inclusivity in educational, professional, and social settings, as demonstrated by user studies and performance metrics.\nPreprint"
